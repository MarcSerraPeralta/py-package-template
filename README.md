## Setting up the git workflow

### Cloning the repo

```
git clone ssh://git@git.example.com/project/repo
cd repo
# create detached HEAD with no files on the directory (cleaner structure)
git checkout $(git commit-tree $(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null) < /dev/null)
# create new worktree corresponding to the `main` branch
git worktree add main main
```

Justification of working with git worktrees: [ref1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uEqYw-N8uE) [ref2](https://morgan.cugerone.com/blog/how-to-use-git-worktree-and-in-a-clean-way/)

Another advantage of using the described method is that it is possible to install different branches of the project in edible mode in different virtual environments (e.g. `pip install -e main/`). 
If git worktrees are not used, then one needs to remember to checkout to the correct branch when using each virtual environment, which is very error prone. 

Best way I found to work with worktrees is described in [this ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54367011/git-bare-repositories-worktrees-and-tracking-branches) 
which corresponds:
* not using `--bare` due to the problems with `git fetch` and `git pull`
* removing everything in the repository in a detached HEAD (with `git checkout $(git commit-tree $(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null) < /dev/null)`) so that in the `repo` directory there are only the worktree directories (so it is cleaner)

### Creating new worktrees

```
git worktree add new-branch-name
cd new-branch-name
git merge main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

The last command (`git merge main --allow-unrelated-histories`) is required to populate the new worktree directory (remember that by default the `repo` directory is an empty detached HEAD). 
The option `--allow-unrelated-histories` is required because the detached head and `main` have no common previous commit so git would throw an error. 

### Setting up PR requests

Allow only `squash merging` for the PR requests. This can be done in `Settings > General > Pull Requests` by unselecting all the options except the `Allow squash merging`.
